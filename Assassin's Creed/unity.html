      <h2>Assassin's Creed Unity</h2>
      <p style="font-family: source-sans-pro; font-style: normal; font-weight: 200;">Assassin's Creed Unity is a historical action-adventure video game developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released in November 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The game is the seventh major installment in the Assassin's Creed series, and the successor to 2013's Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag with ties to 2014's Assassin's Creed Rogue. Set within Paris during the French Revolution, the single-player story follows Arno Dorian in his efforts to expose the true powers behind the Revolution. The game retains the series' third-person open world exploration as well as introducing a revamped combat, parkour and stealth system. Assassin's Creed Unity introduces cooperative multiplayer to the Assassin's Creed series, letting up to four players engage in narrative-driven missions and explore the open-world map. </p>

    <h2>Arno Dorian</h2>
    <p>Arno Victor Dorian (1768) was a French-Austrian Assassin active during the time of the French Revolution.

An orphan who blamed himself for the death of his stepfather, Arno sought redemption by joining the French Brotherhood in 1789 and working to expose the true instigators of the Revolution, whilst also avenging him in the process.

In 2014, his genetic memories were studied by both Abstergo Entertainment and an unnamed member of the Initiates hacker group.</p>
    <p>Born to Marie and Charles Dorian, Arno was raised in a noble household in Versailles. Due to his upbringing, he was well educated, having access to tutors and various books. At some point, Marie, having discovered the Assassin activities of her husband, fled and abandoned her family

In 1776, when Arno was eight, his father was murdered by Shay Cormac. He was adopted by François de la Serre, the Grand Master of the French Templars, out of respect for his enemy. He raised Arno alongside his own daughter, Élise, but kept his Templar involvement a secret from the young boy.</p>

    <p>Thirteen years later, Arno found himself in no end of trouble, having lost his father's watch in a card game and stole it back. When his angry pursuers chased him back to the de la Serre mansion, François attempted to mediate the situation, assigning Arno to assist his butler, Olivier, with whatever chores he would assign, which was cleaning the horses for François' carriage ride to meet Élise...<a href="http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Arno_Dorian">For more visit the AC wiki</a></p>
    <h2>Unity Preview</h2>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBJhzmHF5rs" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>   Assassin’s Creed Unity is a game of impossible peaks and disappointing valleys. Its highs of movement, customization options, and just the city of Paris itself pierce the sky like the spire of Notre Dame. On a purely technical level, Unity is a marvel to walk through and admire. But at the same time, a lot of my journey through the French Revolution felt as cold and heartless as the darkest depths of the catacombs. I was never given a real reason to care about new Assassin Arno, or the events that transpired. Instead, I had to find my own fun throughout my 30 hours in Unity, which was generally easy to do in its large sandbox assassination scenarios. However, it’s a bit disappointing to see how few of the long-standing problems with the series have been solved by the upgrade to the new generation of gaming hardware.
The new consoles’ graphical power is put to good use in Ubisoft’s recreation of 18th-century Paris, which is absolutely stunning. As we’ve come to expect from an Assassin’s Creed game, it’s sprawling, gorgeous, and absolutely packed with sights to see and things to do. Climbing to the top of Notre Dame, synchronizing with one of the series’ iconic viewpoints, and watching the camera pull back and show you the breadth of your universe is staggering.</p>

    <h2>The Gameplay</h2>
    <p>Combat for the game was rebuilt, with fencing being used as an inspiration for the new system. In addition to returning weapons from previous games, Assassin's Creed Unity introduces the Phantom Blade. The Phantom Blade uses the mechanics of a crossbow to fire a silent projectile a great distance, while still serving the same role as the Hidden Blade in previous Assassin's Creed games. Navigation for the game was also overhauled. Ubisoft created new "Parkour Up" and "Parkour Down" mechanics to make it easier for the player to scale buildings in either direction. Additionally, Arno learns new parkour moves throughout the game, but the player can also purchase new skills as well. With the updated, larger crowds, new interactions with them are also available. The crowd regularly presents many activities, appearing organically, that the player can choose to engage with at their leisure. Examples include interfering in a fistfight, or chasing down a pickpocket.

For the first time, the series will allow players to customise the characters abilities, adopting a skill tree that enables players to assign points earned through gameplay to improve their skills in stealth, mêlée and ranged combat, health. Players will also be able to customise their weapons, armour and equipment to further complement their individual style of play. They will also have a wider selection of weapons available, including swords, axes, spears, polearms, pistols and incendiary devices.</p>
    <h2>Ubisoft apologizes for Assassin's Creed Unity with <bold>FREE DLC</bold></h2>
    <p>The upcoming "Dead Kings" expansion pack for Assassin's Creed Unity will be free for all players, Ubisoft announced today. It's their way of saying sorry for shipping a broken game.

There's no release date for Dead Kings just yet, but anyone who buys Unity on PS4, Xbox One, or PC will get this DLC for free.

"Unfortunately, at launch, the overall quality of the game was diminished by bugs and unexpected technical issues," Ubisoft Montreal boss Yannis Mallat wrote in a blog post today. "I want to sincerely apologize on behalf of Ubisoft and the entire Assassin's Creed team. These problems took away from your enjoyment of the game, and kept many of you from experiencing the game at its fullest potential."

With the DLC free, anyone who bought the season pass or Gold edition of Unity will also receive a free game from Ubisoft. When the offer goes live, season pass owners will get to select from Far Cry 4, The Crew, Watch Dogs, Assassin's Creed Black Flag, Rayman Legends, and Just Dance 2015. No word on whether refunds will also be offered for the season pass.

If you got that $30 season pass—which is looking like a good move, in retrospect—you'll also still get a copy of Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China, a new sidescroller that's slated for early 2015 and will not be included as part of this "we're sorry" free DLC deal.</p>
