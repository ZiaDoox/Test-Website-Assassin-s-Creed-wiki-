         <h2>Edward Kenway</h2>
         <p>Edward James Kenway (1693 – 1735) was a Welsh-born British privateer-turned-pirate and a member of the Assassin Order.

Edward joined the British Royal Navy early in his life and, once accepted, found himself stationed in the West Indies. However, a quick end to the war and the promise of gold, glory and fame eventually seduced him into a life of piracy; it was during this quest that Edward first encountered the Assassin and Templar Orders, and became embroiled in their struggle.

Over the next few years, Edward struggled with the internal conflict that arose from his desire for fame and riches – through the finding of the Observatory - and what he saw as his recompense for bringing death and destruction upon the Assassins. Eventually, Edward chose to entrust the Observatory to the Assassins, and elected to join their Creed.

Edward was the father of Haytham Kenway and the grandfather of Ratonhnhaké:ton; through this line, he is an ancestor of William Miles, and his son, Desmond.

In 2013, an Abstergo Entertainment research analyst was tasked with exploring Edward's genetic memories in order to gather footage for a planned video game, Pirates of Nightmares.</p>

       <p>Determined to prove his worth, Edward pursued his dreams of being a privateer; in late 1712, he boarded a ship chartered for Jamaica with the intention of sailing under the renowned privateer, Benjamin Hornigold. He remained in Jamaica for six months until the Treaty of Utrecht in early 1713, which effectively ended all conflict between the major empires. As a result, British privateers were no longer needed or tolerated in the West Indies, causing Edward to find himself out of work. He subsequently took to piracy and began working aboard a brig, the Jacobite.

In early 1715, Edward's ship attacked a passing vessel which proved to be too much for the crew to handle. With their Captain dead, Edward took the helm and did his best to keep the ship afloat, but to no avail. Shipwrecked in Cape Bonavista, Edward met the only other survivor, an Assassin named Duncan Walpole, whose ship the pirates had attacked...<a href="http://assassinscreed.wikia.com/wiki/Edward_Kenway">For more visit the AC wiki</a></p>

      <h2>The Gameplay</h2>
      <p>The game features three main cities; Havana, Kingston, and Nassau, which reside under Spanish, British, and pirate influence, respectively. The game also features 50 other individual locations—including atolls, sea forts, Mayan ruins, sugar plantations and underwater shipwrecks—to explore, with a 60/40 balance between land and naval exploration. Assassin's Creed IV has a more open world feel, with missions similar to those found in Assassin's Creed, as well as fewer restrictions for the player. The world opens up sooner in the game, as opposed to Assassin's Creed III, which had very scripted missions and did not give players freedom to explore until the game was well into its first act. The player will encounter jungles, forts, ruins, and small villages and the world is built to allow players much more freedom, such as allowing players to engage, board, and capture passing ships and swimming to nearby beaches in a seamless fashion. In addition, the hunting system has been retained from Assassin's Creed III, allowing the player to hunt on land, and fish in the water, with resources gathered used to upgrade equipment.

A new aspect in the game is the Jackdaw, the ship that the player captains. The Jackdaw is upgradeable throughout the game, and is easily accessible to the player when needed. In addition, a new underwater component has been added. The player has access to a spyglass, allowing the examination of distant ships, along with their cargo and strength. It can also help determine if an island still has animals to hunt, treasures to find, high points to reach for synchronization or additional side-quests to complete, such as assassinations and naval contracts. An updated form of the recruit system introduced in Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood has returned, allowing Edward to recruit crew members. While Kenway's crew will remain loyal to him, can be promoted to captain acquired ships and are needed to assist in boarding enemy vessels, they cannot assist in combat or perform long-range assassinations, as in previous games.</p>
